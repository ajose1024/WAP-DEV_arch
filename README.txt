WAP - WEB Application Platform
------------------------------

The WAP is, in first place, an architecture for application development
with WEB interface.

It's architecture is independent from the programming language used and
although it's 1st implementation is being done using PHP, it is, by no
way, PHP dependent.
Other implementations, in other programming languages, will follow within
time
